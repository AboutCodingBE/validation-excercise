# write a function
# this function validates the sensor of an incoming shipment
# the function takes an argument - the argument is a list of sensors id
# and it will show which sensors are okay and which sensors are not

# the function also states clearly what is not okay about a sensor
# for instance, the firmware of the sensor might not be okay: the application would say so

# *** if the sensor has incompatible firmware with the latest configuration - it should indicate this until
# the firmware and configuration have been installed

# The firmware is compatible starting from version FW:23-09-2022:03.
