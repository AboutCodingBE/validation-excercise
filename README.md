# General information about doing this challenge

### Agreements 

When you start with this exercise, you agree with the following points: 
* I, Nicholas Ocket from About Coding, can use your code in any way I want. In particular, but not exclusively, I can use your 
code or parts of your code as example in my course, in articles and posts on social media or to create any other content in regard to 
helping and instructing other people.
* Other people will be able to see your code. This is obvious, so obvious that it might be overlooked. 
* **I will never disclose any of your personal information anywhere without asking you if I can**. This means that when I use your code or parts of it, 
I will never show nor mention any personal information in the content I create when using your code or parts of it. 
* I will never make fun of people nor behave in a disrespectful way. The goal of these challenges is to learn. **I expect the same from you**. 
* You agree to not interfere with the code of other people, to push on branches of other people or any other destructive behaviour.

### How this challenge works
This challenge consists out of 3 phases. First, there is the base challenge. You should do this first. Design and create
a solution to the best of your potential. When you are done with the base challenge, check out the branch called 'evolution_1'. This 
is the next level of the challenge. This is either one or a series of changes that needs to be done in your solution. 
Since software is every changing, and part of software design is to adapt to change, change should be part of the challenge. When you are done, 
you can check out the branch called 'evolution_2' which is yet another level of the challenge. 

These evolutions have the intention to challenge you and your design skills on the different aspects of software design. With these evolutions, I aim
to give you a taste of what might happen in real life situations. 

### Practical guidelines: 

Here are a couple of guidelines for doing this challenge: 

* Start by creating your own branch. You can take the `main` branch as your base branch. 
* Do all of your commits on this branch. You will be the only one working on it.
* When you are ready for an evolution, **create a new branch from the one you are working on and do the evolution on that branch**.
* After you have done evolution 1 or evolution 2, reflect on how easy/hard it was to make these changes and let me know.
* Other people will be able to see your code and comments. Be smart, don't commit anything personal information.

That is it. Enjoy!
